## Work Experience
## Internship Trainee at Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited
Jun 2025 - Nov 2025 (6 months)
I was responsible in 3 in-house projects in the Department of Accounting and Finance.
Accomplishments:
Designed and developed a Power BI dashboard to monitor employee expense reimbursements. 
- Prevent financial leakage, such as reusing invoices, slightly altering invoice numbers and human entry errors which traditional rules failed to catch. 
- Built an end-to-end pipeline using Microsoft Fabric (Dataflows, Pipeline, Lakehouse, Notebook) and implemented Fuzzy Logic algorithms to score similarity between records, detecting patterns of manipulation and typo errors before visualizing suspicious cases on Power BI dashboard. 
- Delivered Fraud Detection & Audit System which can successfully identify potential fraud cases and erroneous claims for accountants. 
Developed a Financial Assistant Chatbot using the N8N workflow automation platform to answer questions about financial reports. 
- Eliminated the technical bottleneck of CFO and CFA which are required to manually write SQL queries or filter on MS-Excel just to retrieve specific financial figures. 
- Experimented with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining Qdrant Vector Store and SQL AI agent technique retrieved from 
PostgreSQL database. 
- Achieved 78% accuracy in response reliability through manual qualitative assessment (Human-in-the-loop) of LLM outputs. 
Developed a Python-based desktop application to extract multi-format invoice PDFs into structured data. 
- Replaced manual data entry process where accountants had to visually read invoices and type data into specific Excel columns for SAP ingestion and 
eliminate the dependency on a third-party vendor, which required a 24-hour waiting period for results and posed potential data privacy risks. 
- Integrated open-source Large Language Model (Typhoon) with OCR capabilities to accurately parse multi-format PDFs and convert unstructured content 
into SAP-ready tabular formats. 
- Reduced data processing turnaround time from 1 day to under 30 minutes while ensuring sensitive financial data remains secure internally.
